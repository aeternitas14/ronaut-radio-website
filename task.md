# Project: Ronaut Radio Website Customization

## Global Notes:
- DO NOT move or modify the embedded media player — it is already set where it should be.
- This is a cloned template of lotradio.com, currently pulling their Google Calendar data.
- We want to transform it into our own branded station.

---

## ✅ [Task 1] Add Live Chat Under Player

- Add a live chat feature directly underneath the media player.
- Use a simple embedded option like tlk.io or a self-hosted chat system (recommend one).
- Style the chat to match our dark aesthetic.
- Chat should be responsive and work well on both desktop and mobile.

---

## ✅ [Task 2] Replace Lot Radio Schedule with Our Own

- Remove the Google Calendar pull from Lot Radio.
- Build a simple schedule table or JSON-powered calendar system to display:
  - Show title
  - Host name
  - Time range
- Allow us to edit/update shows manually via a JSON file or markdown.

---

## ✅ [Task 3] Fonts and Typography

- Help choose and embed a custom font that fits our vibe (inspired by modern brutalist / vaporwave design).
- Replace existing fonts across the site.
- Ensure compatibility with all devices.

---

## ✅ [Task 4] Styling and Layout

- Keep media player exactly where it is.
- Reorganize layout beneath it:
  - First: Live chat
  - Then: Schedule
  - Then: About / bio section
- All sections should be mobile responsive.

---

## ✅ [Task 5] Help Build Reusable Components

- Convert any schedule blocks or bio elements into simple reusable HTML + CSS or React components (depending on current tech stack).
